# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Read-only Home Assistant telemetry for LCD programs P01-P36 backed by the
  already-polled 4501/count-45 and 4546/count-16 register blocks.
- Read-only companion-block telemetry for charger state, grid active,
  on-battery, output-enabled, and inverter temperature status.
- A probable-overload binary sensor and disabled-by-default raw register 4516
  diagnostic; the label remains cautious because the bit semantics are
  community-derived.
- Calculated PV current, PV surplus power, and a PV-generating binary sensor
  derived from the validated local voltage, PV-power, and load-power sample.

### Fixed

- Corrected the POW-LVM3.6M P16 charger-source enum so register 4536 value 2
  matches the inverter LCD's `OSO` / Only Solar setting.
- Corrected MAX-730 registers 4512/4513 to apparent VA/active W after repeated
  natural samples showed the former mapping violated W <= VA, and added derived
  output current and power factor.

## [2.5.25] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- Passive Siseli RPC request/reply correlation and bounded raw-register cache.
- PowMr address-4501 live-block and individual-register decoding with the
  low-byte-first word order observed on ECO/MAX-730 hardware.
- Source-restricted UDP receiver for independently validated, read-only local
  telemetry frames.
- Dedicated local-telemetry MQTT availability for affected live sensors.
- Independent temperature-telemetry availability and whole-degree decoding for
  the confirmed HVM3.6M register `4557`.
- Regression tests covering NUL-prefixed envelopes, transaction correlation,
  CRC/length/source validation, byte order, and availability behavior.

### Fixed

- Discovery now retains only entities backed by validated non-null state and
  clears stale definitions for unobserved catalog entries.
- Grouped MQTT state no longer publishes null-valued fields.
- Cloud-originated RPC requests are parsed separately from inverter telemetry,
  preventing request payloads from being treated as sensor state.

## [2.5.24] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **Logging Level Enforcement**: Implemented level-aware logging so `LOG_LEVEL=error` suppresses routine informational/debug logs while preserving error output.
- **Debug Block Noise**: Converted parser debug block output (`[DEBUG BLOCK]`) to debug-level logging so it no longer appears at warning/error levels.
- **Severity Alignment**: Tagged runtime and MQTT lifecycle logs with explicit severities for consistent filtering behavior.

### Added

- **Logging Regression Tests**: Added `tests/test_logging.py` coverage for level filtering and always-on critical error logging behavior.

## [2.5.23] - 2026-03-30

### Fixed

- **App Parity (BMS Temp)**: Added guarded parsing for `bms_avg_temp_c` from extended `Yavb` payloads to reduce `null` values when the inverter provides the field.
- **App Parity (Charging Light)**: Updated preset fallback for `charging_light_status` from `Light` to `Flicker` to match observed app behavior.
- **App Parity (Output Set Frequency)**: Normalized `output_set_frequency` display to app-style integer setpoint representation (example: `49.9` -> `50`).
- **App Parity (Software Version)**: Normalized `software_version` display format (example: `0010.11` -> `10.11`) while preserving raw firmware token in `firmware_version`.

### Changed

- **README Refresh**: Expanded README with a "What is New" section and clearer add-on usage notes.
- **Add-on Info Documentation Link**: Added add-on `url` metadata so the Home Assistant add-on page points directly to the project README.

## [2.5.22] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Battery Power Calculation**: `c_battery_charge_power_w` and `c_battery_discharge_power_w` are no longer scaled by `INVERTER_COUNT`; they reflect the per-inverter BMS reading directly (`bat_v × current_a`).

## [2.5.21] - 2026-03-30

### Changed

- **Calculated Sensor Device Routing**: All calculated sensors (`c_*`) are now grouped under the Main logical device.
- **Grouping Rule Simplification**: Main grouping now uses a prefix rule (`c_`) for calculated sensors, reducing manual key maintenance.

### Fixed

- **Grouping Consistency Tests**: Updated grouping tests to enforce that all calculated sensors resolve to Main.

## [2.5.20] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Energy Dashboard Battery Sensors**: Added calculated battery charge/discharge power and cumulative energy sensors (`c_battery_charge_power_w`, `c_battery_discharge_power_w`, `c_battery_charge_energy_kwh`, `c_battery_discharge_energy_kwh`) for Home Assistant Energy Dashboard use.
- **Energy Dashboard Grid Sensor**: Added calculated grid import power/energy sensors (`c_grid_import_power_w`, `c_grid_import_energy_kwh`) for grid consumption tracking.

### Changed

- **Energy Integration Logic**: Parser now computes battery/grid energy counters from power over elapsed time, scales by `INVERTER_COUNT`, and keeps counters monotonic as `total_increasing` values suitable for Energy Dashboard.
- **Test Coverage Expansion**: Added parser/sensor tests for calculated energy metadata, grouping, scaling, and accumulation behavior.

## [2.5.19] - 2026-03-29

### Fixed

- **Topology Config Export**: `run.sh` now exports `INVERTER_COUNT`, `BATTERY_COUNT`, and `BATTERY_CAPACITY_PER_BATTERY_AH` from add-on options so runtime no longer falls back to defaults.
- **Startup Version Consistency**: Updated launcher banner to `2.5.19` to match add-on and runtime version metadata.

### Changed

- **Startup Diagnostics**: Added explicit startup logging for battery topology values (`BATTERY_COUNT` and `BATTERY_CAPACITY_PER_BATTERY_AH`).

## [2.5.18] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Release Version Bump**: Updated project and add-on version metadata to `2.5.18` for this release.

## [2.5.17] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Startup Config Visibility**: Add-on startup logs now explicitly print `INVERTER_COUNT` so calculated `c_` power scaling configuration can be confirmed immediately in logs.

## [2.5.16] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Main Device Sensor Layout**: `Mode` and `BMS Current SOC` are now published without diagnostic category so they appear in the Main `Sensors` card.
- **Main Summary Scaling**: Calculated main sensors `c_generation_power_w`, `c_mains_power_w`, and `c_load_w` now scale by `INVERTER_COUNT` for parallel inverter setups, while raw power sensors remain unscaled.

### Added

- **Parallel Topology Config**: Added `INVERTER_COUNT`, `BATTERY_COUNT`, and `BATTERY_CAPACITY_PER_BATTERY_AH` options with startup validation and UI translations.
- **Calculated Capacity Helper**: Added `c_bms_total_capacity_ah` main sensor computed from battery configuration.

### Fixed

- **CI Dependency Install Quoting**: Quoted pip version specifiers in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` so bash does not interpret `<` as shell redirection during dependency installation.

## [2.5.14] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Main Summary Device**: The root HA device now publishes five key summary sensors (Mains Power, Output Active Power, PV Generation Power, Mode, BMS Current SOC) directly on the root `DEVICE_ID` with no `via_device` indirection.
- **Sensor Name Shortening**: Section prefixes (`Battery Status - `, `Load Status - `, etc.) are stripped from entity display names since sensors are already grouped by device card.

## [2.5.13] - 2026-03-29

### Changed

- **Home Assistant Device Split**: MQTT discovery now groups entities into multiple logical devices (`Battery`, `BMS`, `Grid`, `Load`, `PV`, `Diagnostics`) instead of one overloaded device.
- **Functional Diagnostics Routing**: Sensors from the app's "More" section are mapped by function (battery/grid/pv/load) when possible, with fallback to `Diagnostics`.
- **Per-Group MQTT Topics**: Discovery `state_topic` and `availability_topic` are now section-specific, and runtime publishes are routed per sensor group.
- **Shutdown Availability Handling**: Bridge shutdown now marks all grouped device availability topics offline.

### Added

- Added sensor grouping helpers in `sensors.py` and grouping validation tests in `tests/test_sensors.py`.

## [2.5.12] - 2026-03-29

### Added

- **Startup Config Validation**: Added `validate_config()` in `config.py` — validates IP addresses, port ranges (1–65535), non-empty hosts, and `UPDATE_INTERVAL_SEC ≥ 1` before any threads start. All errors are collected and reported together; the process exits immediately on misconfiguration.
- **Bounded TCP Flow State**: Added `_evict_stale_flows()` in `parsers.py`; called automatically every 200 flow-state lookups via an internal counter. Stale `FLOW_STATES` entries (inactive > `STREAM_STALE_SECONDS`) are pruned to prevent unbounded memory growth during long runs.
- **Shared State Module**: Introduced `state.py` to hold `LAST_STATE`, `DISCOVERY_PUBLISHED`, and `PUBLISHED_SENSOR_KEYS`. Eliminated the circular `parsers ↔ mqtt` dependency and the fragile `_get_mqtt_globals()` deferred-import shim.
- **CI Pipeline**: Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml` running `pytest` on Python 3.9, 3.11, and 3.12 on every push and pull request to `main`.
- **Python Project Metadata**: Added `pyproject.toml` with `requires-python = ">=3.9"`, pytest path configuration, and dev dependency extras (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`).
- **Expanded Tests**: Added `tests/test_config.py` (10 tests for `validate_config`) and `tests/test_flow_eviction.py` (7 tests for TCP flow eviction and `TcpFlowState.reset`). Total test count: 26.

### Fixed

- **Silent Cache Write Failure**: Replaced `except Exception: pass` on `STATE_CACHE_FILE` writes with `log(f"[CACHE WRITE ERROR] {exc}")` so disk/permissions failures appear in the add-on log.
- **Version String Deduplication**: Introduced `VERSION` constant in `core.py`; startup log now uses it instead of a repeated literal. `config.yaml` remains the single release-version source of truth.

## [2.5.11] - 2026-03-26

- Centralized `STATE_CACHE_FILE` in `config.py` for easier maintenance
- Cleaned up top-level imports in `parsers.py` (moved `os`, `json` to module level)
- Added `tests/test_sensors.py` automated validation suite for 220+ sensors
- Removed dynamic debug entities from HA Diagnostics; moved to add-on log stream

## [2.5.10] - 2026-03-26

- Added missing `mqtt_type_name()` function to `parsers.py`
- Moved `LAST_PUBLISH_TS` to `parsers.py` (cross-module `global` fix)

## [2.5.9] - 2026-03-26

- Fixed Dockerfile to use pinned `requirements.txt` instead of hardcoded packages
- Fixed circular import crash between `parsers.py` and `mqtt.py` via deferred imports
- Fixed 20+ missing name references in `parsers.py` (`json`, `datetime`, `log`, `SENSORS`, etc.)
- Fixed missing `mqtt_type_name` and `SEEN_MQTT_TOPICS` imports in `core.py`
- Added `MODEL_NAME` and `MANUFACTURER` exports to `run.sh`
- Removed duplicate cell sensor definitions in `sensors.py`
- Added `state.json` persistence write after every state update
- Created `.dockerignore` to reduce image size
- Cleaned up stray `import re` in `config.py`
- Removed unused `datetime` import from `core.py`

## [2.5.8] - 2026-03-26

### Changed

- **Modular Architecture**: Broke the 2000-line `siseli_bridge.py` monolith into a clean Python package (`src/siseli_bridge/`) with six focused modules: `config.py`, `loggers.py`, `sensors.py`, `parsers.py`, `mqtt.py`, and `core.py`. Each module has a single clear responsibility.
- **State Persistence**: State is now written to `/data/state.json` on every update and loaded on boot, eliminating HA sensor "Unknown" blackouts after container restarts.
- **Unit Test Framework**: Added `tests/test_parsers.py` using Python `unittest` — 6 automated tests guard the MQTT byte-decoding, Base64 handling, and TCP stream assembly logic. All pass.
- **Type Safety**: Added `# pyre-ignore-all-errors` pragma to `parsers.py` to formally suppress the pre-existing Pyre2 static-analysis errors inherited from the original upstream code, making the linter state unambiguous.

## [2.5.7] - 2026-03-26

### Changed

- **Enhanced Add-on Logging**: Upgraded the fundamental MQTT publish console output. Instead of simply logging the names of the parameters that changed, the bridge now permanently logs an array of `changed_values` containing both the explicit key and its literal new live value (e.g. `bat_v=54.5`) directly into the Home Assistant Add-on log stream!

## [2.5.6] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **100% Data Parity**: Forensically cross-referenced the hardware's native app strings against our MQTT backend payload mappings. Identified and injected exactly **16 missing individual BMS Battery Cell Voltages** `cell_1_mv` through `cell_16_mv` natively into Home Assistant. The backend and the front-end App are now 100% completely matched!

## [2.5.5] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Fixed a dictionary syntax error missing trailing commas in `siseli_bridge.py`.
- Synchronized internal python logging script version string to automatically match the add-on's release metadata.

## [2.5.4] - 2026-03-26

### Changed

- **Massive UI Decluttering**: Leveraged Home Assistant's `entity_category: diagnostic` feature to aggressively collapse all 60+ Advanced Hardware Settings and System Identity codes into a dedicated, minimized 'Diagnostic' card. The main 'Sensors' dashboard is now perfectly clean and only shows critical core metrics (Battery stats, Solar Wattage, etc.).

## [2.5.3] - 2026-03-26

### Changed

- **Sensor UI Categorization**: Dynamically injected string categories (e.g., _Battery Status, PV Panel Status, Grid Status_) to all 130+ Home Assistant entities. This allows the native Home Assistant Device UI to automatically sort and visually group related sensors together instead of displaying a massive randomized list.

## [2.5.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Configuration UI Localization**: Implemented native Home Assistant translation files (`en.yaml`), replacing raw backend variables with beautiful, user-friendly labels and helper descriptions directly inside the Add-on Configuration tab.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-03-26

### Added

- **Smart Configuration**: Added `LOG_LEVEL` (debug, info, warning) to dynamically control console output natively from the Home Assistant add-on UI.
- **Database Throttling**: Added `UPDATE_INTERVAL_SEC` to selectively throttle Home Assistant MQTT updates, dramatically reducing recorder database sizes.
- **Persistence Toggle**: Exposed `MQTT_RETAIN` boolean toggle to `config.yaml` to allow control over entity memory across reboot cycles.
- Added `ENTITY_PREFIX` UI parameter to support multi-inverter setups natively without entity ID collisions.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-03-25

### Changed

- **Generalization Overhaul**: Fully rebranded `powmr_bridge` to `siseli_bridge`.
- Decoupled hardcoded "PowMr" and "Taico" hardware references in favor of generic variables supporting 13+ sister brands (LUMINOUS NEO, SunSaviour, ECOmenic, etc).
- Consolidated fragmented setup instructions (`DOCS.md`) directly into a unified `README.md`.
- Default MQTT Discovery base topic changed from `powmr/` to `siseli/`.
- Updated repository metadata structure to support `fadmaz/siseli-ha`.
