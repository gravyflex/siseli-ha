# ☀️ Siseli Solar Cloud Home Assistant Bridge

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.5.25-blue.svg)](CHANGELOG.md)
[![HA Add-on](https://img.shields.io/badge/Home%20Assistant-Add--on-green.svg)](https://www.home-assistant.io/)

> **Acknowledgment:** This project is an expanded and generalized fork of the excellent work originally created at [yuraantonov11/siseli-ha](https://github.com/yuraantonov11/siseli-ha). Huge thanks to the original author!

Unleash your Siseli-compatible inverter into Home Assistant — **100% locally and instantly** — without relying on external clouds for HA data. The bridge intercepts MQTT traffic to the Siseli Cloud, decodes it locally, and creates sensors via MQTT Auto-Discovery.

> **🔒 Privacy Note:** Your Home Assistant instance intercepts the data for local use, but it simultaneously transparently forwards the traffic to the Siseli Cloud. This ensures your official mobile app continues to work flawlessly.

## ✨ What is New (2.5.25)

- Correlates observed Siseli Modbus read requests and replies, including the
  leading-NUL JSON envelope and low-byte-first register words used by tested
  PowMr ECO/MAX-730 hardware.
- Accepts source-restricted UDP telemetry from a read-only gateway and
  independently validates transaction format, function, address, frame length,
  and Modbus CRC before publishing it.
- Gives locally polled sensors a dedicated MQTT availability topic.
- Reads the original-dongle companion block at `4546`/count 16 every five
  minutes. It exposes charger state, grid/on-battery/output flags, and register
  `4557` as whole-degree inverter temperature with availability independent
  from the one-minute live block.
- Corrects this MAX-730 variant's 4512/4513 mapping to apparent VA/active W,
  adds derived output current and power factor, and exposes register 4516 as a
  cautious probable-overload binary diagnostic plus its raw value.
- Preserves raw 4553-4555 diagnostics (disabled by default) and reports unknown
  model-specific charger codes explicitly instead of guessing their meaning.
- Mirrors the inverter's numbered LCD configuration programs as read-only Home
  Assistant entities; see [PowMr LCD program telemetry](docs/powmr-lcd-programs.md).
- Publishes discovery only for sensors with validated values, clears stale
  retained definitions for unobserved sensors, and omits null grouped state.
- Adds regression coverage for frame validation, byte order, availability, and
  discovery reconciliation.

## 🚀 Quick Setup

### Step 1: Prepare Home Assistant

Ensure the official **Mosquitto Broker** add-on is installed and configured:

1. Go to **Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store**.
2. Install **Mosquitto Broker**.
3. Start it and ensure you have an MQTT user created.

### Step 2: Add Repository

1. Copy this repository URL: `https://github.com/gravyflex/siseli-ha`
2. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings -> Add-ons -> Add-on Store**.
3. Click the three dots in the top right -> **Repositories**.
4. Paste the URL and click **Add**.

### Step 3: Install & Configure

1. Find **Siseli Inverter Bridge** in the store and click **Install**.
2. Go to the **Configuration** tab.
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **INVERTER_IP**: The local IP of your inverter (e.g., `192.168.1.139`).
   - **ROUTER_IP**: The local IP of your router (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
   - **AUTO_INTERCEPT**: Keep `true` to use ARP Spoofing (automatic interception).

   When using the companion read-only gateway:
   - Set **AUTO_INTERCEPT** to `false` if routing is already handled externally.
   - Set **LOCAL_TELEMETRY_SOURCE** to the gateway IPv4 address.
   - Keep **LOCAL_TELEMETRY_PORT** aligned with the gateway destination port
     (default `18900`).

The UDP receiver is telemetry-only. It accepts no inverter commands or Modbus
write functions, and frames from any source other than
`LOCAL_TELEMETRY_SOURCE` are rejected.

- Optional parallel-system fields:
  - **INVERTER_COUNT**: Number of parallel inverters.
  - **BATTERY_COUNT**: Number of batteries in the bank.
  - **BATTERY_CAPACITY_PER_BATTERY_AH**: Capacity per battery in Ah.

4. Go to the **Info** tab, enable **Watchdog**, and click **Start**.

### Parallel Inverter/Battery Scaling

When using multiple inverters in parallel, main summary power sensors are scaled with:

`c_scaled_power = raw_power * INVERTER_COUNT`

This is applied to:

- `c_generation_power_w`
- `c_mains_power_w`
- `c_load_w`

For battery-bank visibility, the bridge also publishes calculated BMS capacity helper sensors on the Main device:

- `c_bms_total_capacity_ah`

All calculated sensors use the `c_` prefix so they are easy to distinguish from raw inverter values.

## 🛠 How it Works (Technical)

The add-on uses multiple methods for traffic interception. For the inverter to start sending data to this add-on, it needs to "think" it is sending it to the Siseli cloud:

### Option A: ARP Spoofing (Auto-Intercept, Recommended)

With `AUTO_INTERCEPT` enabled, the add-on tricks the inverter into sending its data to Home Assistant instead of the router. The bridge parses the data and transparently forwards it to the Siseli cloud.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** You are using ARP spoofing, which is a sensitive network technique. It can trigger security alerts on advanced network setups or enterprise routers (like UniFi or pfSense).

### Option B: DNS Configuration

Configure your router so that requests to the Siseli cloud domain resolve to the local IP address of your Home Assistant.

### Option C: Manual Redirect / Static Route (Legacy)

Create a static route on your router that redirects traffic for the target IP `8.212.18.157` to the IP of your Home Assistant.

## 📊 Available Sensors

This bridge dynamically extracts and exposes **almost every single sensor and data point available in the official Siseli app** (100+ entities) directly into Home Assistant via MQTT Auto-Discovery.

Sensors are now split across multiple Home Assistant devices instead of one large combined device:

- **Battery**
- **BMS**
- **Grid**
- **Load**
- **PV**
- **Diagnostics** (for non-functional or fallback settings)

The "More" tab diagnostics are functionally routed where possible (battery-related settings to Battery, mains/grid settings to Grid, PV/solar settings to PV, output/parallel settings to Load).

The exposed data includes:

- **🔋 Battery & BMS Status**
  - Overall Voltage, Capacity (%), Charge/Discharge Currents, Battery Type
  - Remaining Capacity (Ah), Nominal Capacity (Ah), Min/Max Cell Voltages, and individual cell voltages (1-16)
- **⚡ Grid & Load Status**
  - AC Input Voltage & Mains Frequency
  - Active Load (W), Apparent Power (VA), Output Voltage/Frequency, and Load Percentage
- **☀️ PV Panel Status**
  - Daily, Monthly, Yearly, and Total Electricity Generation (kWh)
  - PV1 & PV2 Voltages, Currents, Wattage, and PV Temperatures
- **⚙️ Advanced Device Settings ("More" tab)**
  - Dozens of configuration points including Working Mode (SBU, UTI, etc.), Charging Priority, Output Frequencies
  - Fan Speeds, Warning Lights, Hardware Switches (AC Charging, Main Output Relay)
  - Customizable thresholds (Float Charging Voltage, Low Battery Alarm, Overvoltage Shutdown)
  - Diagnostic booleans (Abnormal Fan Speed, EEPROM errors, Machine Over Temperature)

## ❓ Compatibility

Tested on:

- RWB1
- PowMr variants
- Taico variants

_Note: It may work out-of-the-box on other Siseli-based devices listed in the Supported Brands section._

## 🧪 Troubleshooting

**No data appearing in Home Assistant?**

- **Check MQTT Connection:** Ensure your Mosquitto broker is running and the add-on logs show a successful connection.
- **Verify Inverter IP:** Double-check that `INVERTER_IP` and `ROUTER_IP` are exactly correct in the configuration.
- **Disable AUTO_INTERCEPT:** If ARP spoofing is blocked by your router, set `AUTO_INTERCEPT` to `false` and try the **DNS Configuration** or **Static Route** methods instead.

**After upgrading, I see duplicate/stale entities in Home Assistant**

- Because the bridge now uses per-section device IDs, entity `unique_id` values changed.
- Remove old retained discovery payloads from your broker, then restart the add-on so discovery is republished with the new grouped devices.
- Example cleanup command:

```bash
mosquitto_pub -h core-mosquitto -t 'homeassistant/sensor/siseli_inverter_1/+/config' -n -r
```

- If your old `DEVICE_ID` was not `siseli_inverter_1`, replace it in that topic pattern.
